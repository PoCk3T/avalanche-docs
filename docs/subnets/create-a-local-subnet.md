# How to Deploy a Subnet on a Local Network

This how-to guide focuses on taking an already created Subnet configuration and deploying it to a local Avalanche network.

## Prerequisites

- [`Avalanche-CLI`](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli) installed
- You have [created a Subnet configuration](create-evm-subnet-config)

## Deploying Subnets Locally

In the following commands, make sure to substitute the name of your Subnet configuration for `<subnetnName>`.

To deploy your subnet, run

`avalanche subnet deploy <subnetName>`

and select `Local Network` to deploy on. Alternatively, you can bypass this prompt by providing the `--local` flag. For example:

`avalanche subnet deploy <subnetName> --local`

The command may take a couple minutes to run.

### Results

If all works as expected, the command output should look something like this:

You can use the deployment details to connect to and interact with your subnet.

To manage the newly deployed local Avalanche network, see [the `avalanche network` command tree](reference-cli-commands#network).

### Deploying multiple Subnets

You may deploy multiple subnets concurrently, but you cannot deploy the same subnet multiple times without resetting all deployed subnet state.

## Redeploying the Subnet

To redeploy the subnet, you first need to wipe the subnet state. This will permanently delete all data from all locally deployed subnets. To do so, run

`avalanche network clean`

You are now free to redeploy your subnet with

`avalanche subnet deploy <subnetName> --local`.
